# Latex Resumes

Latex resumes generated using templates from [resumake.io](https://resumake.io).

To generate a pdf version, open one of the subdirectories and run:

```bash
pdflatex <filename>.tex
```

Note that `pdflatex` has to be installed on your local machine.

Alternatively, you can use a site like [ShareLaTeX](https://sharelatex.com) to build and edit your LaTeX instead.
